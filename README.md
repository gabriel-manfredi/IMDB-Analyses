# IMDB
#### Some data analyses, visualizations, and predictive models related to the Movies and Films area using data obtained from IMDB database.

## Notebooks:
### Word2Vec in non-NLP context
#### In this notebook I use Word2Vec for encoding films' cast and crew into 100-length vectors. The algorithm uses the other members of a movie's cast and crew as context through which it learns the numerical representation of a certain actor/actress. Later I use these novel features as predictors for estimating a movie's popularity, using the IMDB number of votes as a proxy for popularity.
